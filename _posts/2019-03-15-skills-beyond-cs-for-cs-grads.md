*Update: 27th, Jun, 2019: reference how to be a start engineer article*

Let me quote

>Some of us got into this field because it is easier to understand machines than people. As frustrating as computers can be, they at least behave in a logical manner, while human beings often do not.

[Jens Palsberg, PhD](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/azuma.html)

There is so much into the CS field than the CS itself, when you're working with other people, you're working with other *people*, it's probably not a good idea to use CS skills with people, so from that we conclude that there are another set of skills you need to acquire.

You have to learn how to be a people person (not a YES man!), know how to communicate clearly and without the CS itnroversion.

The quote was written in his article about surviving grad school. He shares his experience and things that he whished he knew before starting his PhD. You can find his article “So long, and thanks for the Ph.D.!” [here](https://ronaldazuma.com/hitch4.html), he was talking about how important interpersonal skills are in one section, I totally agree with him and I want to tell you that reports are also important. This is also relevant in the job market, you'll need to produce reports, please your managers and your team mates.

If you want a more industry oriented version, you can check out the article titled *How to be a start engineer* [here](http://www.ece.mcmaster.ca/faculty/reilly/coe4tl4/how%20to%20be%20a%20star%20engineer.pdf) by Kelley, Robert E.

To gain that knowledge, my best advice is to join some student activity, you'll have to work in teams there and please your committee head and your committee members, pretty good training for the job market, huh?
