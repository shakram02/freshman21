Children exist when they're young!, I was impressed when I noticed that too, but we're talking about two different things so let me clarify.

## Memories?
> Do children have an existence with respect to themselves?

This question came to existence when I was watching children (3~5 yo) talking to each other one of them said something close to "last week you started playing, it's my turn" so I told myself that it seems that children do have memory, but how far does it go in the past?

I assumed that memory starts when one has some sense of *self*, so I wanted to observe that and find an answer for it. 

## Self recognition
How do children define themselves? in what sense do they reason about that? what does it mean when a child says `I`? Hopefully they're not just using it from the language that they pick from grown ups, I have no idea if they do, but recognizing oneself is fundamental in a sense that one knows who they are, what defines their character or identity.

## I arrived close to an answer, I guess?
One day I was in transportation and a mom was sitting with her child, he barely could compose sentences but his mom was arguing with him and he clearly asserted that `I` don't want that. What I arrived to so far is that it seems like we can start forming memories once we start speaking, but does that go back further?

## How far back does it go?

What if we do have a sense of self and ability to compose memories far before that? do we remember when we're breathing inside our mom's tummies? I have no answer to this question but it's worth wondering about.
