I heard that sentence more than once, actually I had the same motivation when I joined college. I'm sharing an article that talks about grad school life experience.

<!-- end_excerpt -->

Let me quote


>Some of us got into this field because it is easier to understand machines than people. As frustrating as computers can be, they at least behave in a logical manner, while human beings often do not.

[Jens Palsberg, PhD](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/azuma.html)

The quote was written in his article about surviving grad school. He shares his experience and things that he whished he knew before starting his PhD. You can find his article [here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/azuma.html), he was talking about how important interpersonal skills are in one section, I totally agree with him and I want to tell you that reports are also important.
