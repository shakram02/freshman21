Becoming a NO-body is very important nowadays, it brings lots of relief to one's life. Nobodies are much more than having a "NO" body. Understanding the consequences of becoming a NO-body is important before delving into the guide. Before I describe the process of NO-bodying, I just want to mention that the article is so redundant as the process is pretty well-known, but I'm just writing it for the sake of documentation if humans lost their social knowledge all of a sudden (but still have internet).

## The consequences
becoming a NO-body is such a relief. You'll care less about what's happening around you, enjoy life and go to shopping every weekend and oh!, I almost forgot, you'll be a star on social media as you'll be perfect at selfie-posting, You'll also love yourself much more than any other thing in existence, there's also a good chance that you'll be less prone to chronic diseases and a good chance that you'll die while you're feeling happy, without further ado, let's dive into the guide.

## HOW TO NO-body

The first week in becoming a NO-body is just simple, on your first day you sleep until 11AM. Why bother waking up early? tads only do that, I wonder why they lose the pleasure of sleeping for 10 hours?? science says that it's healthy to sleep 8 hours, but wouldn't you argue that it's much better if you sleep 10+ hours? we need more relaxation that just 8 hours.

Okay, so now it's 11AM, yea btw if you woke up at 11.30 or sometime later, please don't bother yourself life doesn't deserve it. So, after you've woken up the first thing you'll do is EAT!!, you've been sleeping for such a long time and you need food now. What will you eat? gosh!, you're not saying vegetables and milk, AVOID those, they're for boring people. Ordering a big Mac is way to go and don't forget the combo and adding extra cheese.

To oder your food, you'll install a food ordering application, don't ever go to their walking, you must be relaxed in all situations, either order using the app or go to the place by a car, bicycles are also forbidden as they'll get you sweaty, you don't want that.


Okay, now that you've had some breakfast, you need to watch some TV to entertain yourself, I also recommend YouTube, techy kids hold their smartphones all day long and watch YouTube, TV is getting out of style nowadays. You'll watch one of the following categories `entertainment`, `comedy`, `style`, ordered by priority for this time of day (after breakfast). While you're watching, NEVER forget about checking WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram you want to be updated, never miss a single post!

Lunch time already? yeah!. Now you're getting used to the thing, you'll use the same ordering method, but for lunch we need to eat something bigger and better. You'll order Pizza, potato chips and some Coke (hey!, the darker ones are always better -pepsi, coca cola-) and why not invite some friends to come over? they're busy? no problems!!, tell them to order and post your food to Facebook and tag each other, who needs social gathering when social media brought us much closer to each other.

After lunch it's time for the daily chat, you'll do that for 3 hours, use nothing but social media during that time and you MUST be on your smartphone, PCs are for grannies. Find a comfy couch, lay on it and do the thing. 

After the chat party, it's almost 7PM, dinner time? No, not yet! You haven't gone shopping!!!, so now you'll go shopping in a rush you have just 6 hours left in your day. After you go to the mall (never go to shops on the streets, they're for people who want to shop just one thing, we want to shop MANY things), you'll check the style pages, see a good-looking person and find that exact clothes (follow everything, even the colors and accessories) NO-bodies must be good looking all the time, how would you bring the amount of `likes` you like (pun intended :v) when posting selfies if you don't dress in style?

Once you've done checking the pages, here's a checklist for the clothes to know they're in style.

**Boys**
- Don't buy plain-colored shirts, shirts must have window patterns on them. WARNING: don't buy shirts with small windows, buy ones with BIG windows. BIG is AWESOME.
- Make sure that the shirt's arms fold comfortably, you'll need to fold them to look pretty
- Pants must be skinny, you want to show off your strong legs
- If the jeans isn't distressed don't buy them, your legs need to have some air because the weather is hot, make sure the jeans are heavily distressed
- Make sure the pants are shorter that your legs, showing this part of your legs between the socks and the end of your pants is good!
- Bonus tip: Make sure you get a hair cut that makes your hair uneven, they're so in style

**Girls**

Oh my! are you expecting me to type something different for girls? where did "gender equality" go?!!!! follow the same rules for boys for sure, even for the haircuts, if you haven't heard about those haircuts for girls until now, shame on you.

Done with the everything? Now, surf every shop in the mall, the more shops you visit the better it is to know where to buy the full collection in just one place and you'll also make fun of people dressing out of style during that. Why not have some fun talking about the people?, come on!

You've found the ultimate shop, while you're in the fitting room NEVER forget to take a selfie and post it so your friends get excited about what you're going to buy, but don't post a selfie with the clothes you want to buy, you'll lose the excitement and if you post twice you'll get double the amount of likes!

Once you're done shopping, take a selfie with the shopping bags, nope don't open them. Then you'll have diner, make sure that you have your dinner closest to the time you go to sleep, now that you're a food expert, You know better than me what to do.

Time for posting the new clothes? Nope, you'll sleep now. You'll know why soon. The day was very tiring, I know but you'll become an expert soon and it'll be just normal.

Next day, you know when to wake up, how to order your breakfast. After having your breakfast you'll do something different, you'll go out walking in some open area. Gardens?, who said so? you'll go to the mall for sure, gardens are hot and sunny, we want to stay in a cozy place.

Yea, you knew it!, now it's the right time to put on the new clothes, have fun taking selfies! It's also recommended to take one of your friends with you so the selfies appear more warm and to let people know you're a social person. (bonus: this way you'll get both the likes for you and for your friend!, make sure to post quickly and tag them).

What do you do for the rest of the week? you repeat this, but change the configuration a bit so you don't get bored, go to the cinema, go shopping with your friends, have sleepovers, and oh, I didn't mention going to the club (you're the expert now), enjoy!

### Activities to AVOID during the week

1) Reading, reading is so boring, really!! and books just have bloated texts so the authors can make more pages and get more revenue, never touch books (either printed or PDF, printed ones are more hazardous though) and reading is out of style now, you'll be mocked if anyone sees you reading. Why waste all that amount of time reading what other people say? Be bold and stick to yourself, you're the best and you never need to listen to anyone.

2) Learning something related to your field of work/study. Okay, I know that it's obvious! but I jut want to comment on people who do that. They're wierd people who didn't have enough of college and they're dying to get more of it during their free time, how annoying!. I know that what they brag about is jobs, but jobs are everywhere, they're just covering the fact that they're not social people, ignore them completely.

3) Doing anything related to religion; way too old philosophical stuff that keep people fighting, why not just live in peace and forget about all things that make us fight? there's also a good chance that you'll be called a terrorist/extremist especially if you're a Muslim.
You'll find people yelling that Muslims once ruled land from Spain to China, led science and discoveries in their age (which is something obvious if they ruled all that amount of land, just to pick two; Algebra and Algorithms) and defeated both Persians and Romans in the same year deleting the Persian empire from existence and that many countries in Europe gave them gifts and money in order to stay safe from them during the Ottoman empire, just ignore those people who say that. You didn't study that stuff in school I'm sure, so all that is probably fake, and come on!! it's just history, nobody cares about it. We're the children on the "Modern Era". History is long gone and is never important to anybody.

4) Charity and student activities; Waste of time!, why should you care about people who aren't smart enough to take care of themselves? you'll also need to attend boring meetings where people brag about "values" and "being helpful", poor people, they're wasting their time, left all the enjoyment just for nothing. You'll hear some of them brag about the soft skills and people skills, really?! you're the all-social person, you're always with your friends and having fun, how come that they talk about those skills? how unfair life is.

Weekend is close now, you must use it wisely, you'll plan to go the the beach in a remote area to relax, the week was already tough. Don't forget to take your movies with you, it might be the case that the coverage is weak there, you have to get yourself covered. Don't forget to take your power bank.

At the beach, you dress as less clothes as possible, Don't waste the chance to get a tan, when the sun is burning you'll go to the gym to stay in shape. Take lots of selfies whenever the sea/ocean is behind you.

and now we're back to the start of the week, you'll wake at 11PM and repeat.

## Now you're graduated?
Meh, lots of fun is wasted when you have to work, if you don't have to work, lucky you, DONT do it!! But if you have to, you'll perfect system will change a little bit as you'll need to be at work, so you'll probably lose some sleep and skip some shopping trips. But there's a bright future when UBI (Universal Basic Income) is applied, you'll get the money you'll need to live without having to work, what a bright future to look up to!


### Final words
That was sarcasm. (I sometimes believe sarcasm posts, so I loved to state that it is sarcasm)

The sad part is that it's as true as sarcastic it is, what a weird reality that we live in today.

NO-bodies just die, they don't change anything, they have no purpose/cause in life, they just consume, they're negative. 

But yes, it's **the** comfortable option. If you don't become a NO-body, you'll have to bear as much pain as their enjoyment (LOL!). Welcome to the 'Modern Era'. 

There's a catch though, the NO-bodies' joy is just impulsive (a dirac delta to be precise) once they're out of the "entertainment" situation, their misery will start creeping up on them, that's why they always need to be entertained. Non NO-bodies (YES-bodies :v) on the other side are self-fulfilled, they carry their joy wherever they go because it's inside them, although the amount of joy they carry might be less than the impulsive ones the NO-bodies receive, but it's permanent.


### References
Hmm, nothing to mention maybe except for the fact that sleeping 8 hours is healthy. You can find that in the National Sleep Foundation (I didn't bother more than finding the first .org website that I got from Google) [article](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/excessive-sleepiness/support/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need)

Otherwise, these are my observations. I hope they're just wrong.
