Do you use Facebook (or other social media)? Yes, you probably do. Do you want like it's not a good thing to use Facebook or that it wastes your time?...

I won't answer that question but it seems that many of us actually hate facebook or at least want to use it less often. Let's think about that, isn't this dangerous? imagine that there's some sort of food that you know that it'll make you gain weight, but you keep eating it because you can't help it. I guess it's safe that we can call this addiction. We're **addicted** to facebook.

To get addicted to something like drugs, addiction happens because drugs give our brains some chemicals that make us feel happy or whatever. What about facebook, what makes us hooked?

There's lots of psychology behind Facebook, I won't be shy to say that they abuse our psychology so they can generate more revenue by collecting our data and giving them to marketeers to make ads specifically targeted for us. This makes them a lot of money, enough for them to not feel guilty when they waste our precious time. Can you imagine how many hours are wasted everyday on Facebook by people around **the globe**?

Part of what makes us addicted to Facebook is that in that virtual world, we can be whoever we want. For example, if I keep posting stuff about tech, others who check my profile will think that I'm a geek, but that doesn't need to be the case. I might just be subscribing to some tech channel or newsletter and posting what I get without really knowing what that is. You can also see that many people take perfect pictures so they appear so pretty, while in reality they're not that really pretty.

So, we can *appear* to be awesome or **X** without really being. Sometimes we're not told that it's fake so we have no idea about the fakeness concept and take it as a normal thing. It actually requires lots of reflection to detect fakeness patters. For that reason, I guess, is that sometimes we feel so lonely, though we have many friends in the "virtual" world, but it's just virtual in all senses, that won't trick our brain because it knows it's virtual.

As a closing note, we should seek originality wherever we go, even if it's so awkward or will keep you away from *most* of the people, but you really don't want to have tons of hay, a really few grams of gold are much better. **It is** a battle, I assure you, but it's argued that people who had many battles in their lives are the ones who *do* exist, people who are merely existing are those who sit on the safe shore doing nothing but resting (i.e. following the flow). 

Our image is just one part of the story, that's makes facebook to us a place that we want to visit, but are there more reasons? YES!.

If you're excited to know about addictive apps in our lives, I highly recommend reading the following:

> Tech companies use the insights of behaviour design to keep us returning to their products. But some of the psychologists who developed the science of persuasion are worried about how it is being used

I might write about that later, thanks for reading!
