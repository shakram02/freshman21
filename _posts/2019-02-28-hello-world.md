Hello world! This is my first post here. It's been a while since I wanted to have a personal homepage. At the time of writing, I'm currently a TA in data structures subject for 1st year students. I was going through the materials of the subject where [Dr. Hicham]() the subject's professor said that his slides are adopted from [Douglas Wilhelm Harder's](http://eng.staff.alexu.edu.eg/~elmongui/), then I said "oh, maybe I want to explore this" and in professor Douglas's website he had an article named [So, you want to come to Waterloo?](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dwharder/Engineering/), I said to myself "yes, I do but I guess I'm not qualified yet" but I said that I can at least try some of the stuff he mentioned, creating a personal homepage was his first step. I thought that this must be a very important thing to do, since it's on the top of the list and somehow it looks irrelevant, this is a thing that I learnt is to follow the experts as they see what I don't and voila, here is it.

I am a fan of finding other people's (especially hackers) personal websites, that why I love crawling that way, more on that later.

So, this is me. I studied Computer and Communications engineering in Alexandria University, Egypt. I love tech, history, philosophy and having thoughtful conversations. On the other hand, I stopped watching TV since I was 18. I though, hmm why I'm always receiving information? I want to know information on my own, I don't want to be a receiver.

I originally wanted to join faculty of science, but for my future and given the environment configuration I was in, I thought that engineering is the way to go.

I started reading real books in middle school; I read about psychology, astrophysics, physics and read about the subatomic particles. All that happened in Bibliotheca Alexandrina, the community was pretty nice and I met lots of interesting people there.

Currently, I want to pursue masters degree, but I have a simple problem that's becoming chronic; I don't know which field to choose. Let's see what the future holds, 

that's it for today I guess, Thanks for reading.
