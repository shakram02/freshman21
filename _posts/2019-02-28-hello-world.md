Hello world! This is my first post here. It's been a while since I wanted to have a personal homepage.

So, this is me. I studied Computer and Communications engineering in Alexandria University, Egypt. I love tech, history, philosophy and having thoughtful conversations. On the other hand, I stopped watching TV since I was 18. I though, hmm why I'm always receiving information? I want to know information on my own, I don't want to be a receiver.

I originally wanted to join faculty of science, but for my future and given the environment configuration I was in, I thought that engineering is the way to go.

I started reading real books in middle school; I read about psychology, astrophysics, physics and read about the subatomic particles. All that happened in Bibliotheca Alexandrina, the community was pretty nice and I met lots of interesting people there.

Currently, I want to pursue masters degree, but I have a simple problem that's becoming chronic; I don't know which field to choose. Let's see what the future holds, 

that's it for today I guess, Thanks for reading.
