This article discusses what it is to be a computer scientist/engineer from my humble *personal* point of view. Read this article if you want to know what you should feel like after graduation and if you want to know if you're keeping on track.

If you came by this post you're probably an undergrad, during my undergrad study life wasn't easy as I didn't really know what most of the subjects would mean to me after I graduate, 

> I made many false assumptions about subjects and marked them as not important.

**I was wrong** and I hate that I did that now, Why did I do that? Because I didn't get the big picture from the beginning. Hopefully, I will discuss a portion of that big picture in this post and hopefully this series of articles tagged `life-of-an-undergrad`

## Engineers build systems

An engineer is someone who knows how stuff works and utilizes that to make products, this is very general but after you graduate you should be able to look at your smartphone and appreciate the complexity that's within it and how that silicon is actually working; doing phone calls, taking photos and accessing the world wide web via a secure protocol that moves the data all across the globe (hopefully privately). 

Your should also know what AI systems are doing to suggest the next word we want to type in the text message to our comfort, when you press the key on the remote controller of your AC you should know that it's sending Infra red signal to a receiver there, that signal is a bunch of bits that have a command encoded in a way that the vendor specified.

It turns out to be a good engineer, you have to grasp all the knowledge that you can get, because when you're designing a system, A system is something that takes an input and produces output that can be code or circuitry; you name it, you base it on what you saw before, which touches many of the subjects that you studied back in the college. 

> The more systems you study the better your design will be

because you can identify the pitfalls and advantages of the system you're designing from your previous experience.

The systems that I lightly touched upon are transparent to the `regular` person, I'll call other people `regular`, I hope it's not offensive. Well engineered systems are those who exist and you don't feel their existence for example, the sewers systems; almost none of us thought about how they work, but do you think it's an easy task to dispose waste of about 3 million people everyday without causing any trouble? definitely not!

## Systems are nested blackboxes that you unravel one by one

To establish those complex systems they're usually laid out in a layered manner, where each layer isn't concerned with what the others do and can be fixed/replaced/modified by itself. This makes the systems robust and easily maintainable but they become inherently complex to study, since you have to acquire lots of knowledge to get yourself in appropriately.

This implies that you study every layer with its internals, it starts with math, there are many maths!, which represents *truth* to engineers and you build upon it, transistors wouldn't have made it without mathematics and accordingly, everything that's built on top of it. Discrete mathematics prove truth via proofs and accordingly everything that requires a proof, like what makes an algorithm work. 

> The more solid your foundation the better you can be as you will be able to grasp more complex concepts more easily.

This means that earlier subjects; Discrete Maths, Conventional Maths, Data Structures, ...etc are more enabling that other subjects, which is what we are not told during studying and since they're so abstract (i.e. more like ideas and far from reality) we tend to give them less weight, Although this "abstracstness" is what makes them so powerful.

## Superpowers and their price

Learning abstract things makes our brains apply to concepts whenever possible. The concepts that we learn become embedded in our thinking, which enables
us to generate better solutions for non-engineering topics like event organization or even babysitting, you learn from the child's behavior what makes them distracted and do it so they stay silent as long as possible. Engineering essentially is a lifestyle not just a profession, you try to optimize almost everything possible and you get more intuition than `regular` people.

This can't be obtained for free, right? So, in order to get those superpowers you pass by the stage of transformation from a `regular` person to an `engineer`, enrolling in an engineering course itself doesn't do this transformation for you. You have to exert lots of mental efforts and it'll often be so hard, pressing and annoying. But remember, you can just pay that for a about 4 years and get its benefits for your entire life. I guess that it's a good deal.

So, whenever you feel that things are getting tight, remember that you're growing your brain. It's the same way muscles work, they hurt you after exercise because they're growing stronger, the more you exercise something, the better you become at it; presentation skills, coding, patience and the list goes on.

## Conclusion
To be a good engineer you have to delve into the internals of what's around you and reflect upon how they work, open the black boxes and think through them. To gain those super skills, you have to know lots of stuff, which is what you're doing in college. This won't be an easy ride because of the benefits you're obtaining for yourself, so be resilient and never break yourself, know that this is what's happening now and embrace it.

## More on that?

Give Paul Graham's article [Undergraduation](http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html) a try. Paul Graham mentioned hackery in his article, [this](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is) is one explanation for it by Eric Raymond

Enjoy!
